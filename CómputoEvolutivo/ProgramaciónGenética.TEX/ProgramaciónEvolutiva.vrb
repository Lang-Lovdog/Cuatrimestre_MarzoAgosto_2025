\frametitle{The problem, the model and the solution}
\begin{blur}

  Think about a problem. Usually, to solve some problem, we can solve it
  using tools that are already available. For example, if we want to know
  the position of a particle at a certain time in an uniform rectilinear
  motion problem, we can solve it by a simple equation.

    And we can call it a simulation, which is the most common thing, and
    easiest thing to do with a computer.

class Particle:
  def __init__(self, x0, v0):
    self.x0 = x0
    self.v0 = v0

  def simulate(self, t):
    return self.x0 + self.v0 * t

  def __repr__(self):
    return f'Particle(x0={self.x0}, v0={self.v0})'

if __name__ == '__main__':
  p = Particle(0, 10)
  print(p.simulate(10))

    But now, what happens if we haven't an equation or an algorithm to solve
    the problem? If have data and we need to know how it's behaving? What if
    we need to predict it's behaviour? Maybe some nonlinear phenomena,
    a signal, classification, or something not so intuitive as common
    problems?

    Here is where modeling comes in \cite{Eiben2015}. And here is where genetic programming
    started to gain relevance.
