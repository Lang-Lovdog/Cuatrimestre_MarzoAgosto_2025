# Abstract
There are several problems when handling large feature vectors for classification. Most commonly found is
computational resources consumption. Sometimes those features are redundant and can be reduced
getting similar results with fewer descriptors, reducing classification complexity, computational
resource consumption and training time.
On the other hand, it's well known that different classifiers have different definitions,
leading to a variety of results from poor to highly precise.
In this experiment two approaches were tested for a dataset which describes a scholar desertion
study giving a set of features which will be reduced. Using GRID method to select the best models
and EDAs for dimensionality reduction.
