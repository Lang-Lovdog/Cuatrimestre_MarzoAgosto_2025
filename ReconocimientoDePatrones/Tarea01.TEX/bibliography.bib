  abstract  = "In this paper, we present a circle detection method based on
               genetic algorithms. Our genetic algorithm uses the encoding of
               three edge points as the chromosome of candidate circles (x, y,
               r) in the edge image of the scene. Fitness function evaluates if
               these candidate circles are really present in the edge image.
               Our encoding scheme reduces the search space by avoiding trying
               unfeasible individuals, this results in a fast circle detector.
               Our approach detects circles with sub-pixellic accuracy on
               synthetic images. Our method can also detect circles on natural
               images with sub-pixellic precision. Partially occluded circles
               can be located in both synthetic and natural images. Examples of
               the application of our method to the recognition of hand-drawn
               circles are also shown. Detection of several circles in a single
               image is also handled by our method.",
