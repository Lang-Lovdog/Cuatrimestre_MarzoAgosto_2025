abstract = {Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural
            events and the relations among them can be treated by means of
            propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can
            be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated
            logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical
            expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net
            behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many
            particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions
            are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one
            assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other
            and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same
            time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.}
