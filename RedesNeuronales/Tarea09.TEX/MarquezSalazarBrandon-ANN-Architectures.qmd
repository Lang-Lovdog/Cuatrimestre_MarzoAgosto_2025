# Introduction

*(The "Why": 2-3 paragraphs. State the problem, its importance, and the purpose of this summary.)*

# Core Concepts and Methods

*(This is the body. Use subsections for different methods.)*

## Key Method One: [e.g., K-Fold Cross-Validation]

*   **Purpose:** Define its goal in one sentence.
*   **Process:** Briefly describe how it works. "The dataset is partitioned into k equally sized folds..."
*   **Advantages:** List key benefits.
    *   *Robust estimate:* More reliable than a single train-test split.
    *   *Efficient data use:* All data is used for both training and validation.
*   **Disadvantages:** List key drawbacks.
    *   *Computational cost:* Requires training k separate models.

## Key Method Two: [e.g., Dropout]

*   **Purpose:** Define its goal.
*   **Process:** Briefly describe how it works.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   *Prevents overfitting:* By breaking up co-adapting neurons.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   *Longer training time:* Requires more epochs to converge.

# Applications and Discussion

*(The "So What": 1-2 paragraphs. Where are these methods applied? What are the current challenges or trade-offs? This is critical for a good grade.)*

# Conclusion

*(Synthesize the main points. Restate the most important takeaway. "The choice between Method A and Method B often depends on computational budget and dataset size...")*
